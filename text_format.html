    <p class="line_height line_indent t_decor_under">Prakash Jha's big-budget ensemble political drama Raajneeti was Kapoor's first release of 2010. The film, which starred Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgn, Arjun Rampal, Manoj Bajpayee, Katrina Kaif and Sarah Thompson in prominent roles, was inspired by the Indian epic Mahabharata and Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather.[33] Kapoor's role was of Samar Pratap (based on the characters of Arjuna and Michael Corleone), the younger heir of an Indian political dynasty, who is reluctantly drawn to politics after the assassination of his father. Kapoor described it as his first complex role and considered it a departure from the "lover boy roles" that he had previously played.[28] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India reviewed: "The film finally belongs to Ranbir Kapoor who perfects the art of minimalism—and literally grows before your eyes—as the simmering volcano that cannot be held back, once it erupts."[34] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times, however, was more critical of his performance which he considered "stony rather than calculating—especially jarring compared to the histrionic turns around him".[35] Indian trade journalists were apprehensive of the film recovering its ₹600 million (US$7.1 million) investment.[36] The film, however, proved to be a major commercial success with worldwide earnings of over ₹1.43 billion (US$17 million).[37] Kapoor received a third Best Actor nomination at Filmfare for the film.[18]</p>
